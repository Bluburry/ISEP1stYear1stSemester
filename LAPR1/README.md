This folder contains the group project developed at the end of the 1st semester.
It utilizes java to use and analyze the SIR method using Euler and Runge-Kutta equations, and gnuplot to create graphics out of the created tables.

This is project was independently made by me, as I wanted to study and understand everything that went on.
However, with the help and input of my colleagues, we wound up using this as the project we actually presented.

There are a few extras that I put together to help with developing the accompanying report.
